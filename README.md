# Pi-hole DHCP Watchdog

## Description

This **systemd-based watchdog service** continuously monitors the Pi-hole DHCP server and automatically restarts the **FTL service** if it becomes unresponsive.  
It is designed to mitigate a common issue where the DHCP server stops working after a temporary Wi-Fi disconnection when the router switches channels on Wi-Fiâ€“based Pi-hole setups.

2. **Navigate into the directory**
   ```bash
   cd pihole-dhcp-watchdog
   ```

3. **Make the setup script executable**
   ```bash
   chmod +x pihole-dhcp-watchdog-setup.sh
